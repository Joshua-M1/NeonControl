# NeonControl

## Description
 A simple platforming game created as a final project for D.E.C. in Computer Science.

## Gameplay
 The game is composed of selectable levels where the player character must navigate the environment to the goal. The twist? the player does not
 have direct control over their own movement. The player character is a spring that - upon collision with barriers - bounces around in a manner
 correlating to real-world physics. The only input the player may provide is what direction to angle the spring. 
 
 With a theme based on bright neon colours and a copyright-free soundtrack, this is less a game and more a proof of concept for a potential future
 project.

## Download and Running
 The intended method to run the game is through an Java IDE of the user's choice - with a corresponding version of a JavaFX library installed.
 A standalone executable of the game was created and functioned, but due to Java updates and lost knowledge on the creation process, this executable and 
 its accompagnying files have been lost to time.

## Disclaimer
 This game - and repository - was made while we attended CEGEP, during a time where we were not shown how to properly use Git, Git Bash, etc.
 Due to this, some things in this repository may seem strange - such as it being forked in early 2023, poorly explained commit messages, etc.
 While some of it has been fixed/reorganized, much of it is still of questionable nature and will remain as such.
