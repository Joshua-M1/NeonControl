# NeonControl

## Description
 A simple platforming game created as a final project for D.E.C. in Computer Science.

## Gameplay
 The game is composed of selectable levels where the player character must navigate the environment to the goal. The twist? the player does not
 have direct control over their own movement. The player character is a spring that - upon collision with barriers - bounces around in a manner
 correlating to real-world physics. The only input the player may provide is what direction to angle the spring. 
 
 With a theme based on bright neon colours and a copyright-free soundtrack, this is less a game and more a proof of concept for a potential future
 project.
